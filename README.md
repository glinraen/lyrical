# Lyrical

## A Music Lyrics Repository 

### Intro

The concept for Lyrical is a repositor for music files. Many songs are online, in many formats that are difficult to read and to keep neat. I wanted a place to upload collections of lyrics and music that would keep one format. It is a full stack web application.

### Technologies

+ HTML5
+ CSS/Sass with Foundation
+ Javascript
+ Ruby
+ Ruby on Rails

##### Ruby Gems
+ upload care - for image upload
+ google-vision-api
+ pull-tempfile
+ foundation-rails - for styling

[Google Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=2015-q1-cloud-na-gcp-skws-freetrial-en&gclid=Cj0KEQjwwry8BRDjsbjMpPSDvagBEiQA5oW0nMYffDHrpuoDCx1hqWjmDhTtCQqYxjuChu2MmSd7eY0aAqRN8P8HAQ) - OCR detection

To install Lyrical, fork and clone the repo, install the gems, and bundle. Make sure you read the the Google Vision documentation carefully to obtain an API key and set up the data correctly for the correct detection of text (OCR).
